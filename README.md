# Firewall Simulation with Flooding

This repository contains a firewall simulation program designed for a specific network topology using flooding techniques. The simulation aims to demonstrate how a firewall can effectively filter and manage network traffic in a complex network environment.

## Overview

The firewall simulation is built to operate within a specific network topology, utilizing flooding algorithms to manage network packets and enforce security policies. The program includes functionalities such as packet filtering, access control, and network monitoring.

## Features

- **Topology Configuration:** Define the network topology and set up nodes, switches, and routers.
- **Firewall Rules:** Create and configure firewall rules for packet filtering and access control.
- **Flooding Simulation:** Simulate network flooding scenarios to test firewall performance under high traffic conditions.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic, log firewall activities, and analyze security events.
- **User Interface:** Simple command-line interface (CLI) for configuring the firewall and running simulations.
